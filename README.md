## Sinopsis
You need to solve the puzzle and make all characters cross from one end of the map to the other. 
This is an extension of a classical riddle setup now with more islands, different paths, and new constricts.
Follow the rules given in the game and good luck!

## Controls
Click to move animals in and out of the boat. 

Select menu buttons with the arrows or cursor.

Pause the game with TAB and change levels by clicking RIGHT SHIFT while on pause. You can go to the menu from there too.

Press C to zoom on the islands and move the mouse to see around you. Also you can change the island in focus with the arrows.

Press R to restart.

Mantain B to see all map with bird-eye.

## Scene maker:
There is a function called sceneMaker in the class Stage which helped us build a scene in an easy way. 
By just passing the pointer to an EnityMesh and a float representing movement speed, an object can be easily moved and set in the World.
